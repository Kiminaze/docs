## Entitlement

### <font style="color:red;">Issue</font>

You receive the message `You lack the required entitlement to use <resource name>` in your server 
console after trying to start the resource.

### <font style="color:green;">Solutions</font>

- You might just need to restart your server! Sometimes it can take a few minutes to register that 
you bought a package.
- The resource you bought needs to be used on a server associated with the same account. You can 
view your license keys or generate a new one on the [Portal](https://portal.cfx.re/) where you 
initially downloaded the resource in the first place.
- Zap-Hosting servers come with a default key that is not directly associated to your account. You 
need to generate a key and enter it inside of your server settings to be able to use keymaster 
resources.
- If the server is running on someone else's Cfx account, you can transfer a resource **once and 
irreversible** to another Cfx account on the keymaster website.
