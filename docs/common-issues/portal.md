## Entitlement

### <mark style="color:red;">Issue</mark>

You receive the message `You lack the required entitlement to use <resource name>` in your server 
console after trying to start the resource.

You might just need to restart your server! Sometimes it can take a few minutes to register that 
you bought a package.

The resource you bought needs to be used on a server associated with the same account. You can view 
your license keys or generate a new one on the [keymaster site](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) where 
you initially downloaded the resource in the first place.

Note: Zap-Hosting servers come with a default key that is not directly associated to your account. 
You need to generate a key and enter it inside of your server settings to be able to use keymaster 
resources.

If the server is running on someone else's Cfx account, you can transfer a resource **once** to 
another Cfx account on the keymaster website.
