* Go to the back of a transport and press the button to **deploy a ramp** (if the transport has one defined).
* Drive onto the transport and press a button to attach/detach the vehicle.
* **Fully Multiplayer compatible**. It does not matter who deployed the ramp or who attached a vehicle. Anyone can interact with anything!
* You can **drive onto a moving truck** and attach your vehicle. Or detach from a moving truck.
* Set the maximum speed a transport vehicle can move at if the ramp should be deployed.
* You can **define your own transport vehicles** (e.g. if you use modded vehicles) by using a series of commands ingame. No need to edit a file!
