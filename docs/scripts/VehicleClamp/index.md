## Description

VehicleClamp allows you to attach wheel clamps to most ground vehicles. The clamps can be attached and detached by using the appropriate item or options can be added to e.g. your job menus or other systems by using the available [client](https://docs.kiminaze.de/scripts/vehicleclamp/exports-client) and [server](https://docs.kiminaze.de/scripts/vehicleclamp/exports-server) exports. A chat command is available for admins and other staff.

Just be close to the wheel you want to clamp. Use the item or your own implementation to attach it. Once attached you can still start the engine but the vehicle can't be driven anymore. The vehicle can still be moved by external force though, it is not frozen in place.

This script can be used as a standalone resource or together with your favorite framework. Check [Integration](https://docs.kiminaze.de/scripts/vehicleclamp/integration) for more information.
