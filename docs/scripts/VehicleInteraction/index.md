## Description

This script allows a new way to interact with a vehicle. The menu can be opened by holding Alt and right clicking any vehicle on your screen (and not just in the middle like most targeting menus!).

VehicleInteraction provides a long list of options for vehicle control like (un)locking a vehicle, toggleing the engine and headlights and much more!

Apart from the menu it also allows for many vehicle based features like turning off auto shuffle to driver seat or allowing to shuffle from rear left to rear right etc. (see list below)
