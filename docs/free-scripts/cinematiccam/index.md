## Description

The CinematicCam provides the user with an easy to use ‚Äúadditional‚Äù camera, that can be moved 
freely in the world. Additionally it can be attached to any npc/player/vehicle in the game in order 
to provide something similar to a ‚ÄúDashcam‚Äù or just for fancy screenshots or videos. You can set it 
on a specific position and angle relative to your character and the camera will move with the 
entity.
