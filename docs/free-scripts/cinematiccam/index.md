## Description { .purple-title }

The CinematicCam provides the user with an easy to use ‚Äúadditional‚Äù camera, that can be moved freely in the world.
Additionally it can be attached to any npc/player/vehicle in the game in order to provide something similar to a ‚ÄúDashcam‚Äù or just 
for fancy screenshots or videos.
You can set it on a specific position and angle relative to your character and the camera will move with the entity.
