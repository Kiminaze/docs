## [DEPRECATED]

Please check out the new [OrbitCam](https://docs.kiminaze.de/free-scripts/orbitcam) that allows for 
much more customizability and does the exact same thing but better!

## Description

Well the title is pretty self-explanatory. It lets you orbit the camera around your character when 
you are dead. The game takes all control from you when you die, which I think as an absolute no-go 
of as a developer. NEVER take too much control from the player!
