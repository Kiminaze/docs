Our Bot only collects information with prior consent by the user. All other processes only handle

pressing a clearly labeled button indicating the condition it is tied to.

#### 3.4.2. Data Collected

- Cfx.re identifier of the user

#### 3.4.3. Purpose of Collection

The identifiers are used to verify purchases before support is provided for resources acquired

#### 3.4.4. Access and Protection

Access to the identifiers is strictly limited to us and their use within the Bot. They are securely 
stored on our server and are not shared with third parties.

#### 3.4.5. Data Retention

Identifiers are retained indefinitely or until the user requests deletion of their data.


### 3.5. Resource Telemetry Data

#### 3.5.1. Data Collection

Telemetry data ("data") is collected **only** when telemetry is **enabled** by the customer via a 
provided configuration variable ("convar").
Telemetry can be enabled or disabled at any time at the customer's discretion. It is disabled by 
default and opt-in, unless the end user is running an experimental version where it defaults to 
opt-out.

Once enabled, data is transmitted under the following conditions:

- A defined number of log entries is reached,
- The respective resource is stopped,
- The server is shutting down,
- A script error has occured,
- A client disconnects from the server.

#### 3.5.2. Data Collected

- Cfx.re (FiveM) identifier of the server owner
- FiveM server build version
- FiveM game build version
- Resource version
- Timestamps of log entries
- Client logs generated by the resource
- Server logs generated by the resource
- Script error reports

**Note:** No personal data such as names or IP addresses is collected, apart from the 
aforementioned Cfx.re identifier.

#### 3.5.3. Purpose of Collection

Data is collected to:

- Diagnose and debug issues
- Provide technical support and troubleshooting
- Improve the stability and reliability of the resource

#### 3.5.4. Access and Protection

Data is transmitted via secure HTTPS.

Access to the data is strictly limited to the copyright owner (Philipp Decker) and authorized 
support staff.

#### 3.5.5. Third-Party Access

Data is generally not shared with third parties.

In support cases, data may be used to illustrate issues to the customer or their developer.

Support tickets are visible to only those with access to the corresponding resource section on 
[our Discord server](https://discord.kiminaze.de).

#### 3.5.6. Data Retention

Collected data is retained for **a maximum of 8 days**, after which it is automatically and 
permanently deleted.

If telemetry is disabled, previously collected data is alsoe erased within **a maximum of 8 days** 
or until the user requests deletion of their data.
