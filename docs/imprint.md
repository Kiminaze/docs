Access to the identifiers is strictly limited to us and for the use with the Bot and they are 
stored securely on our server.

Identifiers are stored for an indefinite amount of time.


## Resource Telemetry Data

### When is information collected?

Telemetry data ("data") is collected **only** when telemetry is **enabled** by the customer via a 
provided convar. Telemetry can be enabled or disabled at any time at the customer's discretion. 
Telemetry is disabled by default and opt-in unless the end user is using an experimental version 
where it defaults to opt-out.

Once enabled, data is sent in the following situations:
- Defined number of log entries is reached,
- The resource is stopped,
- Server is about to be shut down,
- Script error has occured,
- Client disconnects from the server.
